# Countryballs
Project voor tekenschool, ja ik gebruik github hiervoor, deal with it.

Built from the ground up, only html and css is used right now.
Might add a javascript in the future.
Hosted on github pages here: https://thom-ernst.github.io/Countryballs/

All code in the program is owned by me, or free from any copyright.
The imagery in this project is mine, and you are permitted to use it, just credit me for my arts.
